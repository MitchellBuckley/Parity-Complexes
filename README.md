These four files are enough to formalise Ross Street's `Parity Complexes' up to the excision of extremals algorithm (Theorem 4.1).

Strictly speaking, we have formalised sections 1 and 2, Propositions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and Theorem 4.1.

The files exhibit dependence in the following order:
 - mySetoids.v (code that enables us to rewrite with sets (Ensembles))
 - myFiniteDefs.v (code that resolves issues with Same_set when the axiom of extensionality is ignored in Ensembles file) 
 - PreparityComplexes.v (Definition of parity complex without axioms (preparity complex), and Section 2)
 - ParityComplexes.v (Sections 1, 3, 4)
